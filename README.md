Gravitational physics simulator Developed a physics engine with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simulate the interaction and movement of spherical bodies under gravitational forces. The application visualizes real-time trajectories and dynamics based on defined physical rules.

This project was developed in collaboration with Daniel Roldan Serrano (https://github.com/danirold)
